"PROJECT DISCRIPTION" :  Project Overview :
This project is aimed at building a Weather Visualization Dashboard using Python by fetching live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap public API. The goal is to develop a script that extracts real-time weather parameters for a specific city, processes the data, and visualizes it in the form of a dashboard using Python libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib. This kind of dashboard can be a foundational tool for weather monitoring systems, environmental dashboards, or personal applications requiring climate insight.

Tools and Technologies Used :
Python 3.11.3: Core programming language used for scripting.
Requests Library: Used to send HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API and retrieve data in JSON format.
Seaborn & Matplotlib: Powerful visualization libraries used to create bar plots from the API data.
OpenWeatherMap API: A free public API that provides weather data for any city in real-time.

Project Workflow :
The project workflow is divided into the following key steps:
1. API Integration :
The first step involves integrating the OpenWeatherMap API. An API key is generated by registering on openweathermap.org. This key is used to authenticate requests and access weather data for any city. The Python requests library is used to send a GET request to the API endpoint with the city name and units of temperature (metric).
2. Data Extraction & Processing :
Once the response is received from the API, it is parsed as a JSON object. Key weather metrics are extracted:
Current temperature
Feels-like temperature
Humidity
Atmospheric pressure
Wind speed
These values are stored in a dictionary for easy manipulation and plotting.
3. Data Visualization :
Using the extracted values, a bar chart is created using Seaborn and Matplotlib. Each weather parameter is represented as a bar with its respective magnitude. The graph is:
Properly labeled with axis titles.
Styled using the Blues_d palette for visual appeal.
Exported as a .png image for reporting or documentation.

Final output :
A fully working Python script.
A visual dashboard saved as an image (weather_dashboard.png)
API response and processed data.

Learning & Application :
Through this project, we gain hands-on experience with:
Consuming REST APIs
Working with JSON data structures
Data visualization using Python
This project bridges the gap between raw data collection and data storytelling, showcasing how open data can be transformed into meaningful visuals that help in decision-making.
